PHP Skills Assessment - Junior Developer - Exercise 1
=============================

The purpose of this exercise is simply to demonstrate a programmer's understanding of interface and abstract classes.
This is not to demonstrate how complex or advanced one's programming style is.
Keeping it simple, create an app that can serve cards to a user using the provided class/interface files.

This is not a 'game of cards' - there is no game logic, simply the ability to shuffle a deck of cards and issue a card when requested.

There are no face cards to contend with - the cards will simply be values from 1 to 5, there are no suits ('hearts','diamonds','spades', 'clubs') to consider.

Make sure there are no duplicate cards dealt.
